# CSS

CSS is a language that can be used to add style to an [HTML](/wiki/HTML) page. CSS is not a programming language due to not really being able to implement logic, however there are ways around that due to awesome people making software that allows for variables and more inside CSS. Alternatively there is [Javascript](/wiki/Javascript) to help manipulate the DOM as well!

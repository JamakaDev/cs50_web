# Java


Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It too is a high level language like [Python](/wiki/Python), however the syntax of Java has been deemed to be difficult not only in comparison to [Python](/wiki/Python)!
